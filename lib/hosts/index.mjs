// The host registry.
//
// astro-code's loop (discuss → plan → execute → verify), its registry, roadmap,
// canon and wave layering are all host-agnostic — 16 of 19 lib modules have no
// idea which agent harness is driving them. What differs per host is only:
//
//   1. where its config lives, and which dirs to populate
//   2. how commands/agents are discovered (path, file format)
//   3. how session hooks / the status line are wired
//   4. how to run ONE headless agent
//
// A host adapter answers exactly those. Claude Code, Codex CLI and Cursor are
// wired; Pi is researched and slots in as one more file. The three were
// designed against together precisely so this contract would not have to be
// retrofitted around a second one.
//
// ## The contract
//
//   id            string, stable, used in config + CLI output
//   label         human-readable name for install output
//   placement     { commands, agents, ext, mode } — where files land in a
//                 config dir and how they get there ('symlink' | 'copy')
//   detect()      boolean: is this host present on the machine?
//   configTargets()  Map<dir, label> — every config dir to populate
//   renderCommand(name, src)    -> { filename, content } in the host's format
//   renderAgent(name, src)      -> { filename, content } in the host's format
//   registerHooks(dir, home)    wire hooks/status line; returns boolean, or a
//                                report object (host-specific shape — e.g.
//                                Cursor's { branch, events, statusLine, … })
//   unregisterHooks(dir, home)  reverse it
//   execCommand(opts)           -> { command, args } for ONE headless run
//                                  (optional; only hosts that support it)
//   parseResult(stdout, task)   -> the reply value, or null/undefined meaning
//                                  "failed" (optional; `runWave` falls back to
//                                  the raw-text `readResult` path for hosts
//                                  without it — see lib/hosts/runner.mjs)
//
// Every function that needs the astro home takes it as an argument. Adapters
// must NOT capture it at module load: the install tests re-import with a
// cache-busting query to swap in a fake $HOME, and a module-level constant
// would be frozen at first import and silently ignore it.
